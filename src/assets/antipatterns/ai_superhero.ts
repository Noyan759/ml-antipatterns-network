  "description": "High dependence on a single resource to take the AI system from prototyping to production. This resource understands every aspect of the development and deployment of the AI system and is often referred to as the AI Superhero.",
  "causes": "Teams usually have such an AI Superhero due to the possession of a broad range of skills by this individual resource. His/her set of skills might range from machine learning research, data engineering, software engineering, and development operations to project management. For specialized applications domains, the AI Superheroe might also possess skills in a specific field. Hence this resource is also referred to as a Unicorn and is an extremely important member of the team.",
  "impact": "Over-reliance of a team or a project on such AI Superheroes can cause problems. The high demand for such resources can cause them to leave the team before the machine learning system is completely developed or functional. This can destructive effects on machine learning and can result in a complete halt unless a replacement is found. On the other hand, the business can scale up too quickly for the rest of the dependent team to keep up.",

  "detectionStrategies": "",
  "mitigationStrategies": "This high dependency problem on a single resource can be fixed by limiting the role of the AI Superhero to a narrowed-down primary role and having other members of the team work around the unicorn. This will slowly and eventually train the rest of the team to acquire the skill set of the unicorn. Another time-consuming and costly solution would be to hire additional members to the team for each of the AI Superhero's skills.",
